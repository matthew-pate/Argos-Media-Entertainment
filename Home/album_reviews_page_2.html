                <p>The first track, <q>Daylight</q>, is an upbeat, poppy song that features nasally vocals. The

                    half bad – easy to decipher, but not extremely blatant. Though the instrumentation masks and
                    directs
                    attention away from the lyrics, the track, <q>Daylight</q>, features lyrics like: <q>These shoes

                    even when the band yields sub-par arrangements and lyrics. Of course, this is uncommon for the band.
                </p>


                <p>Death Cab For Cutie has been wrongly clumped into the category of modern emo music in recent years.
                    This
                    newest strain of emo music that has hit the mainstream airwaves is not tradition, nor is it decent.
                    The
                    new strain mares all past respectable compositions of emo music. This is something Death Cab For
                    Cutie
                    is not. Death Cab For Cutie is, in fact, an indie-rock band. <a

                    The opening

                    they are
                    still entertaining and easily connected to by the listener. <q>Confessions of a Big Brother</q>
                    reaffirms my
                    liking of the band. It’s soft and quiet, a great mix. The album seems to have a pattern of each song
                    having its equal follow, <q>Come around and love me.</q> After the equal is played we move on to a
