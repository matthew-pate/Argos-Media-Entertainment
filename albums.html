                    heard Michael Franti & Spearhead’s Yell Fire! in 2006, I couldn’t relate. Or, I wasn’t in
                    the
                    mood to hear it and relate to it. Music takes time. You have to listen numerous times
                    throughout
                    your life to connect to it. It wasn’t until about seven (7) years after Yell Fire!’s release

                    disappointment,
                    there’s always something to be optimistic about. This reminiscence isn’t due to the lyrics, rather
                    it is
                    due to the
                    sloppy arrangement of instruments which the lyrics combine with. Nada Surf reminds me of a teenage
