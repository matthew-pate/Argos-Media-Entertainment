                <p>With so many new albums released every year, how are we, the listener, supposed to relate to
                    each
                    and every one? It’s just not possible. At least not at the very moment of its release. When
                    I
                    heard Michael Franti & Spearhead’s Yell Fire! in 2006, I couldn’t relate. Or, I wasn’t in
                    the
                    mood to hear it and relate to it. Music takes time. You have to listen numerous times
                    throughout
                    your life to connect to it. It wasn’t until about seven (7) years after Yell Fire!’s release
                    that I began to enjoy it. <a href="blog/DeathCabForCutie_Kintsugi.html">Continue

                <p>About a week or two before the album dropped on January 24, 2012, NPR began streaming Nada Surf‘s new
                    album, The Stars
                    Are Indifferent to Astronomy, in its entirety. I listened to the album about six times straight
                    through,
                    two times a
                    day, on my way to and from work.</p><br>

                <p>Without fail, every Nada Surf release reminds me of adolescence and how, regardless of the stress and
                    disappointment,
                    there’s always something to be optimistic about. This reminiscence isn’t due to the lyrics, rather
                    it is
                    due to the
                    sloppy arrangement of instruments which the lyrics combine with. Nada Surf reminds me of a teenage
                    garage band breaking
                    in to the scene.</p>
