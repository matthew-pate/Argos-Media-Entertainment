                <p>The Decemberists‘ Hazards Of Love was made available on iTunes 10 years ago today, March 17,
                    2009. The
                    record was
                    released a week later on March 24, 2009.</p>

                <p> It wasn’t unexpected. It wasn’t shockingly different from what we had heard in the past. Fans of
                    The
                    Decemberists didn’t
                    mind the work it required to unfurl the lyrics, they had enjoyed the constant dictionary
                    consults and
                    imagery in the
                    past. <a href="/blog/HazrdsOfLove.html">Continue reading....</a></p>

                <p>In a debut album riddled with purposeful responses to those who claimed she'd never make it in the
                    industry, Alice Merton's strong-willed and persevering lyrics are impaired by what may be assumed as
                    her insecurities. As the bass hits, those impactful moments are narrowly missed or avoided. It's
                    almost as if Merton's search for a “home” can be felt even in the denial that it is underway. Merton
                    can be heard fighting to live on her own terms and timing while borrowing from others. <a
