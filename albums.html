                <p> It wasn’t unexpected. It wasn’t shockingly different from what we had heard in the past. Fans of
                    The
                    Decemberists didn’t
                    mind the work it required to unfurl the lyrics, they had enjoyed the constant dictionary
                    consults and
                    imagery in the
                    past. <a href="/blog/TheDecemberists_ TheHazardsofLove.html">Continue reading....</a></p>

                <p>In a debut album riddled with purposeful responses to those who claimed she’d never make it in the
                    industry, <a href="https://www.alicemerton.com/">Alice Merton</a>‘s strong-willed and persevering
                    lyrics
                    are impaired by what may be assumed as her
                    insecurities. As the bass hits, those impactful moments are narrowly missed or avoided. It’s almost
                    as
                    if Merton’s search for a “home” can be felt even in the denial that it is underway. Merton can be
                    heard
                    fighting to live on her own terms and timing while borrowing from others. <a

                <p>With so many new albums released every year, how are we, the listener, supposed to relate to
                    each
                    and every one? It’s just not possible. At least not at the very moment of its release. When
                    I
                    heard Michael Franti & Spearhead’s Yell Fire! in 2006, I couldn’t relate. Or, I wasn’t in
                    the
                    mood to hear it and relate to it. Music takes time. You have to listen numerous times
                    throughout
                    your life to connect to it. It wasn’t until about seven (7) years after Yell Fire!’s release
                    that I began to enjoy it. <a hreff="dddfff">Continue reading...</a></p>
