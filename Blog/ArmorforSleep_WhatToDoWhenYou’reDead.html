            <p>Never, never, never waste your money on <a href="http://www.armorforsleep.com/">Armor for Sleep</a>’s
                <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/What-When-Dead-15th-Anniversary/dp/B08JB1Z728">What To Do When
                        You’re Dead</a></span>! I know the cover
                art looks interesting and the small booklet inside, <q>A Guide To What To Do When You’re Dead,</q> is
                hysterical, but do not, <strong>DO NOT!</strong>, buy it. I finally listened to it today. For a couple
                years now the
                album’s cover art has haunted me. Tapping me on the back to buy it or give it a listen. I never budged.
                A friend gave me a listen, as we were just sitting in class with nothing to do for an hour and a half. I
                had my new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod">iPod</a> with me, but had neglected to bring the
                headphones with.
            </p>

            <p>I will give the band this: They do have some, <strong>some</strong>, nice beats and their vocals are at
                some points,
                though very few, tolerable. Maybe this band will mature. I’d be surprised to see what they could do when
                they’re not trying to get on the radio or on <a href="http://www.mtv.com/">MTV</a>. The lyrics sounded
                pretty good, I have yet to give
                them a full looking at.</p>

            <p>I am sorry to those of you who like this band. Not because I don’t want to offend you, but because you
                have &#9608&#9608&#9608&#9608&#9608&#9608 music taste. For that, I am sorry.</p>

            <p>But, this thing in me does want to say that I don’t mean to offend you. I just, personally, can’t take
                it. If you can, more power to you, but why do you like the band? Why do you like the album? Could they
                be any more of a cookie-cutter band?</p>
