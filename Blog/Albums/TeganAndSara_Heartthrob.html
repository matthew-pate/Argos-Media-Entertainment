            <p>Is it possible that the music of 2013 will be a return to the synth-heavy pop of the 1980s and early
                1990s? Maybe the
                composition is not quite to <q>synth-heavy,</q> but in the early days of 2013 and judging by the
                accomplishments of 2012,
                it’s not far off. <a href="http://www.teganandsara.com/">Tegan and Sara Quin</a> (Tegan & Sara, T+S) are
                among those pioneering this shift in 2013,
                if only
                because of a release date in the first quarter of the year, with <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartthrob">Heartthrob</a></span>. I’ll ignore the reasoning
                behind the
                title of the album because it’s no big mystery and has been investigated by numerous reviewers already.
                Having been
                listening to T+S since <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tegan%2Band%2BSara/If%2BIt%2BWas%2BYou">It Was You</a></span>
                (2002) and exploring their music further with every listen,
                <span class="album_title">Heartthrob</span> was a
                somewhat expected move. The sisters, now in their early thirties (30s) continue to make perfect songs
                for teenagers,
                those in the midst of breakups, or in dysfunctional relationships. Unfortunately, for those not in one
                of those
                broad categories, something may be lost. Those not engaging in these types of teenage-era or
                teenage-esque
                relationships may feel a slight disconnect between the music, the lyrics, and themselves. However,
                listeners can
                easily regain this connection and are coaxed to do so as the mind recalls relationships-past where these
                would have
                been perfect tracks for a specific situation. Where was <span class="album_title">Heartthrob</span> back
                then?
            </p>
            <br>


            <p>It is, of course, difficult to listen to <span class="album_title">Heartthrob</span> without thinking of
                T+S’s past work. The new release
                is
                synth-heavy
                and radio-ready, but definitely not a <q>sell-out. <span class="album_title">Heartthrob</span> If there
                    was any fear of the fan base becoming shaken
                    and falling
                    off,
                    it was misplaced – probably just anxiety of a decent album worthy of the charts. While the
                    well-known
                    T+S scream is
                    lost
                    on many tracks, it shines through the maturity on “Goodbye, Goodbye,” and “Drove Me Wild.” From the
                    beginning of
                    “Closer” it is easy to hear the <a href="http://www.cyndilauper.com/">Cyndi Lauper</a>, Roxette, <a
                        href="http://www.benatarfanclub.com/">Pat
                        Benatar</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Olivia%2BNewton-John">Olivia Newton John</a>
                    influence,
                    intentional or
                    not. Turn to the <a href="http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com/">Yeah Yeah Yeah</a>’s <span
                        class="album_title">It’s Blitz!</span> or Karen O’s solo work for a comparison of similar,
                    more
                    recent
                    pieces. Of
                    course there are also similarities that can be drawn to <a href="http://www.thetingtings.com/">The
                        Ting Tings</a> and even <a href="http://katyperry.com/">Katy Perry</a>. Luckily,
                    Tegan and Sara
                    achieve what the aforementioned two could not. For those able to spot the other influences that I
                    did
                    not mention,
                    congratulations – you get a point.</p><br>

            <p>Tegan and Sara show a softer, less harsh side of themselves in <span
                    class="album_title">Heartthrob</span>. Is it because they’ve grown
                up, gotten
                older,
                become less energetic and can’t scream like they used to? Or is it a maturity that comes with their age?
                The
                frightening
                fact may be that it is truly neither. As a band they may have grown, but to still be writing and
                composing these
                teen-like tracks, while great for fans, depressingly reminds us that things may never get better. There,
                like all
                Tegan
                & Sara tracks, continues to be at least one line that will throw a listener to the ground, and though
                the sisters
                may
                have lost the tempo and beat that makes their listeners do the <q>indie dance,</q> that same
                head-bobbing
                travels lower
                and
                the foot-tapping creeps higher, converging at the shoulders – making the listener move, along a
                horizontal plane, as
                if
                they held within them a violent heartthrob.</p><br>
