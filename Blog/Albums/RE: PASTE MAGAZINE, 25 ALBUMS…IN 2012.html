                    Albums We’re Looking Forward to in 2012 :: Blogs :: List of the Day :: Paste</a>.</p>

                <q><a

                    href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/writers?name=tyler+kane">Tyler Kane</a>, and I are quite
                possibly
                looking in the same
                direction – Not something I share with all Paste contributors. Though the list of future releases does
                not fully reflect the 25 albums I’m looking forward to be released in the coming months, that is, if
                there are 25 albums even.

            <h4>25 Albums We're Looking Forward to in 2012</h4>

            <p>As usual, the list begins with the most anticipated albums in reverse order. Typically I will look
                forward to a full length album based on a band’s previous full length studio release. Paste (or at least
                the author) plays by different rules. Sure I look forward to album based on <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play">EPs</a> and Singles, but I don’t
                list them in such a way that would suggest that they have already won some sort of victory over more
                well-established groups. <a href="http://www.thelumineers.com/">The Lumineers</a> may be decent and
                deserving of their placement as #25, or maybe
                I’m just prejudice because I’ve never given them a listen.</p>

            <p>Previously, I have stated that great bands of the past should not be given placement based solely on
                their discography and popularity. <a href="https://www.thebeatles.com">The Beatles</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths">The Smiths</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra">ELO</a>,
                <a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.com/">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href="http://www.sexpistolsofficial.com/">Sex
                    Pistols</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)">Genesis</a>; all of
                these great bands are considered classics in their own right, but it does not mean that their next album
                (if there were to be one) would be any better or more anticipated than the last. What about <a
                    href="https://www.u2.com/">U2</a>? Since
                <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Dismantle-Atomic-Bomb-U2/dp/B0006399FS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326219039&sr=8-1">How
                        to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a></span> (2004) – and possibly even during – I have been less then
                ecstatic and
                have surely not anticipated the band’s follow-up albums. Don’t get me started on <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono">Bono</a> (Paul David
                Hewson). A once great band just riding their own coattails.
            </p>

            <p>Okay, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys">The Beach Boys</a> are also releasing a <a
                    href="http://www.brianwilson.com/">50th Anniversary album along side a tour</a>. A band that was
                considered Oldies when I was a child. This kind of follows along the same line as U2. It’s also similar
                to my feeling toward <a href="https://www.paulsimon.com/">Paul Simon</a>‘s <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprise-Paul-Simon/dp/B000F0UV1S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326219259&sr=8-1">Surprise</a></span>
                (2006). Wanted to
                hear it, but didn’t necessarily anticipate
                it. In fact, I probably waited to hear Simon’s new release more so than this Beach Boys release and
                wasn’t too impressed.</p>

            <p>I’ve only heard samplings of <a href="https://www.nadasurf.com/">Nada Surf</a>‘s <span
                    class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Bonus-Dig-Nada-Surf/dp/B0011HF61E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1326219322&sr=8-2">Lucky</a></span>
                (2008), but liked it. I’d say that I’m anticipating their
                new album to an extent. If only to hear the changes that have occurred over the years. From <span
                    class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Low-Nada-Surf/dp/B000002HM6/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1326219451&sr=1-1">High/Low</a></span>
                (1996) to today. The last Nada Surf album I purchased was <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Weight-Gift-Nada-Surf/dp/B000AMJD9W/ref=pd_sim_m_2">The Weight is a
                        Gift</a></span> (2005). I also saw the
                band perform live in <a href="https://www.austintexas.org/">Austin, Texas</a>. I think one of the
                openers was <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bellaparker">Bellaparker</a>.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The list continues with a few bands that I have not taken the time to listen to and form a real opinion
                of. Those bands are as follows: <a href="https://miniaturetigers.com/">Miniature Tigers</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.lostinthetrees.com/home.htm">Lost in the
                    Trees</a>, <a href="https://www.punchbrothers.com/">Punch Brothers</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_(band)">Tennis</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Spirit">Delta
                    Spirit</a>, <a href="https://www.leonardcohen.com/">Leonard Cohen</a>, <a
                    href="https://sharonvanetten.com/">Sharon Van Etten</a>, <a href="https://thexx.info/">The xx</a>,
                and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diamondrugs">Diamond Rugs</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_(band)">Islands</a> also appear to have an album to be
                released in 2012. I recall the first album I had heard of the
                band’s, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Return-Sea-Dig-Islands/dp/B000ELJAU6">Return to the Sea</a></span>
                (2006). From what I heard, I liked, yet I never purchased the album and never
                really became a part of the Islands fan base.</p>

            <p><a href="https://damienjurado.com/">Damien Jurado</a>. I’ve never really anticipated anything from
                Jurado. Listened once or twice, never picked
                up an album. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_%26_the_Nuclear_So_and_So's">Margot and the
                    Nuclear So & So’s</a> will also release a new album. This album I do anticipate
                to some degree. I really enjoyed finding the debut album <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dust-Of-Retreat-Explicit/dp/B0026G4DZY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1326300888&sr=8-3">The
                        Dust of Retreat</a></span> (2006) during one of my
                visits to <a href="https://waterloorecords.com">Waterloo Records</a> in Austin, TX. The releases
                thereafter – <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-Animal-Margot-Nuclear-Sos/dp/B001EDOC56/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1326300888&sr=8-2">Not
                        Animal</a></span> (2008), <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Animal/dp/B001N84AM2/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1326300888&sr=8-10">Animal!</a></span>
                (2008),
                and <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Buzzard-Explicit/dp/B003YNP0G4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326300888&sr=8-1">Buzzard</a></span>
                (2010) – have been quite different than that initial release (and, in my opinion, not as
                good), yet I still look forward to the band’s release to see what new changes have been made.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.mumfordandsons.com/">Mumford & Sons</a> is also scheduled to release a follow up
                album. I guess I’m somewhat anticipating this.
                I’d at least like to see what the band has in store. <a href="https://www.brucespringsteen.net/">Bruce
                    Springsteen</a> paired back up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Street_Band">E
                    Street
                    Band</a> and <a href="https://www.houseoftomorrow.com/tmf.php">The Magnetic Fields</a> both are
                releasing albums. Unfortunately, though I enjoy both bands, I feel
                that they are falling into a similar category as U2 and The Beach Boys.</p>

            <p>I didn’t enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleigh_Bells">Sleigh Bells</a>‘ <a
                    href="http://www.amazon.com/Treats/dp/B003P72KGC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326220375&sr=8-1">first
                    album</a>, not that it was bad necessarily, it just didn’t seem to have
                the quality that many albums in the genre have. <a href="https://www.andrewbird.net/">Andrew Bird</a> is
                also set to release a new album. I
                haven't listened to Bird much since his 2005 release, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Andrew-Bird-Mysterious-Production-Eggs/dp/B00070Q7VY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1326220432&sr=8-3">Andrew
                        Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs</a></span>. I
                caught a few tracks of <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Noble-Beast-Andrew-Bird/dp/B001LTVBX4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326220432&sr=8-1">Noble
                        Beast</a></span>, but that was it. For the most part, I’m not anticipating it. <a
                    href="https://www.thelongwinters.com/">The
                    Long Winters</a> are also expected to release a new album. Yeah, I’m pretty much anticipating that
                album. I
                have yet to be discouraged from the band.</p>

            <p>Don’t get me started on <a href="https://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/">Sigur Ros</a>. That can wait for a
                different entry.</p>

            <p>While I could also write a complete entry about <a href="https://www.theshins.com/">The Shins</a> and
                their influence in my life as well as
                their <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Garden_State">life changing</a> track <q><a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwCmcB0XMw">New Slang</a></q>, let me just say that this
                will probably be my most anticipated
                album release of the years – though I am hesitant to say that after <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mercer_(musician)">James Mercer</a>‘s collaboration with
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse">Danger Mouse</a> (Brian Burton) as Broken Bells and
                the self-titled
                album release. Don’t get me wrong. It was good, but not <q>Shins-good.</q>
            </p>

            <p>Maybe I’ll make my own top 25 list. Maybe show Paste Magazine what’s what.</p>

            <p>Sorry, if this entry isn’t too interesting or really in-depth. I just felt like writing something and if
                I put it off too long, this would all be old news. Also, if you’ve been living under a rock since 2001
                and haven’t heard the song below, you should really give it a listen.... It will change your life.</p>
