                it just <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stuart%2BMurdoch">Stuart Murdoch</a>’s, or is it something
                completely different? The album’s charm is lacking, though
                Murdoch’s lyrics of sexual inadequacies has left his fans pining for new tracks and albums. The most
                terrible injury done by the album is most certainly Murdoch’s attempt at writing songs to be sung by
                others rather than him.</p>

            <p>The primary female vocalist, <a href="https://www.cathrineireton.com">Catherine Ireton</a>, has a voice
                much like that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooey_Deschanel">Zooey Deschanel</a>, who
                teamed
                up with <a href="http://www.mwardmusic.com/">M. Ward</a> to release <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.last.fm/music/She%2B%2526%2BHim/Volume%2BOne">Volume One</a></span> in 2008
                under the moniker <a href="https://www.sheandhim.com">She & Him</a>.</p>

            <p>The opening track is a bluesy version of Belle & Sebastian’s <q>Act of the Apostle, Pt. II.</q> The song
                was
                shortened slightly, as was the title. The original version, though the female vocals add a softness
                that
                Murdoch was unable to achieve under Belle & Sebastian, was better done than this bluesy version.
                Both
                are likable though.</p>

            <p>At times, the album gets to be more like the soundtrack to a musical, rather than a film in the form
                of
                music – which is still an odd concept, considering a film is planned to accompany the album. The
                album
                should be advertised more aptly as the soundtrack to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2141751/">God
                    Help the
                    Girl</a> (film) rather than a film set to
                music.
            </p>

            <p>The title track, <q>God Help the Girl,</q> would easily fit into a Belle & Sebastian album, which this is
                not.
                And it is rightly so. The album is not one that lends itself to Belle & Sebastian’s historical
                discography. Murdoch’s brainchild, though backed by Belle & Sebastian, is missing elements of the
                very
                band that it grew from.</p>

            <p>If you can’t wait to hear the new version of <q>Funny Little Frog,</q> consider calming yourself, as the
                track
                loses most of what made it so enjoyable – namely, the way Murdoch pronounced <q>throat.</q> The
                vocalist,
                Brittany Stallings, does away with the quirky <q>thro-at</q> and glosses over many of the weighty
                lyrics,
                leaving the track rather unimportant compared to the original. Stallings sings the track with more
                soul,
                which is a pleasant change, but still leaves the listener shrugging.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the vocalists sing a majority of the songs with a lack of sincerity and inadvertently
                leave the listener uninterested. The singers seem to be expecting Murdoch’s lyrics and story to do
                most
                of the heavy lifting.</p>

            <p>Overall, the album seems to be pushing the narrative and development of characters rather than
                supporting
                the singers’ and band’s capabilities. If viewed in this way, the album is perfect. But, if this is
                so,
                why release the album so much sooner than the film? As much as Murdoch wants to associate the album
                with
                Belle & Sebastian, it’s probably best that it’s not.</p>
