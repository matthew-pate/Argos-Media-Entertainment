                had missed something. I enjoyed
                the
                album, mainly the tracks: <q>Take, Take, Take;</q> <q><a

            <p>But, I still felt that I was missing something. I couldn’t calmly sit down and listen to the album
                straight through. For a few months I was unable to just sit down and listen to the album straight
                through. I always moved on to some other important task or changed the music. I couldn’t bring myself to
                listen to them completely. And, I felt bad. I liked them, but didn’t feel like I was giving them the
                credit they were due.</p>

            <p>I finally sat through the album and enjoyed it, but I still felt something was missing. What is the hype
                about? Yes, they’re good, but what else? My friend Ben had the two albums, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Stijl-White-Stripes/dp/B000068OSJ%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000068OSJ">De
                        Stijl</a></span> and <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_%28album%29">Elephant</a></span>. Still
                not listening to the albums fully, I decided to pick up the <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Blood_Cells_%28album%29">White Blood Cells</a></span>
                album. I listened to it
                for days. I then continued listen to the other albums.</p>

            <p>I could see the hype. The band had matured. You could hear as they developed their own sound. From their
                scratchy beginning to their crisp new sound. I go back and forth from liking the new album to liking the
                older albums. I finally found what I had missed.</p>

            <p>I had missed their formation. I had missed out on listening to them when they put out their first
                release. I missed their growth. For that, The White Stripes, I am sorry. Many of their songs are great.
            </p>

            <p>Each album holds great lyrics and tracks. If you were like me and think you missed something, maybe you
                missed the growth of the band as well. Give them another try. If anything, they’re bound to grow on you.
