            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="article_text">
            <p>One of my resolutions this year has been to reignite my passion of and for music. One of the best ways to
                do this, I assume, is to listen to more music, seek out more music, as well as read and write more about
                music. Thus, I have begun to put together a list of my most anticipated albums of 2012.</p>

            <p>I don’t think there are that many albums that I am really looking forward to this year. It’s not the line
                up that we saw in the early years of the first decade of the 21st century. It’s not the time of <a
                    href="https://www.rilokiley.com/">Rilo
                    Kiley</a>, <a href="https://www.deathcabforcutie.com">Death
                    Cab For Cutie</a>, <a href="https://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle & Sebastian</a>, or a number
                of other great artists’/bands’ album
                releases. It’s not the flux of great records that appeared in 2006. In fact, who knows if Death Cab
                will
                return to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y1nBatIwjU">the sounds of old</a> or if Rilo Kiley
                will ever <a
                    href=http://www.spinner.com/2011/07/13/rilo-kiley-blake-sennett-band-broken-up/">reunite</a>.
                Poisoned by the mainstream, I guess.
                I
                don’t mean to suggest that I dislike the move the bands made when signing with the major labels. I’m
                actually proud that they had their day in the sun and found the spotlight; however, I’m feeding off
                of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Sennett">Blake Sennett</a>‘s (Rilo Kiley, <a
                    href="https://theelectedband.com/">The Elected</a>) comments made to Spinner in which he states that
                he <q>felt
                    like
                    there was a lot of deception, disloyalty, greed and things [he didn’t] really want to submit
                    [himself]
                    to.</q> Before I go too far off track and begin dealing again with the fall of Rilo Kiley, let us
                move
                on
                to the list.

            <h3>The Albums that I am Looking Forward to in 2012</h3>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h4><a href="https://www.catpowerthegreatest.com">Cat Power</a> : TBA</h4>
            </p>

            <p>The problem with Cat Power (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Power">Chan Marshall</a>) is that
                she is self-destructive even though her voice and
                musical composition are great. I don’t mean self-destructive in a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> kind of way. I mean
                self-destructive in a way that she almost fears her audience or fears that the audience will judge her.
                I saw Cat Power perform at the <a href="https://www.aclfestival.com/">Austin City Limits Music
                    Festival</a> (ACL Fest) in 2006 while she was
                touring after the release of <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Cat-Power/dp/B000C0X3ZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326395888&sr=8-1">The
                        Greatest</a></span> (2006). Early in 2011, Cat Power mentioned that there may be a
                new release in 2012, but nothing further appears to be confirmed. While an album of covers, <span
                    class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Jukebox-Deluxe-Cat-Power/dp/B000Y0H1EY/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1326395888&sr=8-6">Jukebox</a></span>,
                was
                released in 2008, I’m still waiting for her next original release.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Kweller’s last effort <span class="album_title"><a
                            href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Horses-Dig-Ben-Kweller/dp/B001N2Z414/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1326395993&sr=8-4">Changing
                            Horses</a></span> (2009) was a swing to the more Country/Folk styling than his
                    previous Folk/Pop/Rock combinations. His newest release, <span class="album_title">Go Fly a
                        Kite</span>
                    seems to be a return to his
                    previous stylings. I’m not sure if the track samples due it enough justice. If anything, I’ll
                    give
                    the
                    new album a lower ranking, I mean, I don’t expect it to be <span class="album_title">On My
                        Way</span> or
                    the self-titled, <span class="album_title">Ben Kweller</span>.</p>

                        and Love and You</a></span> (2009) will be released in early to mid-2012. Every album the
                brothers have release have had a number of great tracks. The vocals tend to provide their own
                harmony.
                Without the release of any mp3s or having heard anything much about the new album, I can only work
                from
                the past.

                <p>Another band I stumbled across during my foray into the music scene. I enjoyed the band’s self-titled
                    album and what I heard from their sophomore album, <span class="album_title"><a
                            href="http://www.amazon.com/Tones-Town-Field-Music/dp/B000LPR56Q/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1326396178&sr=1-4">Tones

                            fragmented style of the band’s early work....</a></q> To me,
                    a lot of it sounds the same and I don’t see a real abandonment of the original style. At least not
                    one
                    drastic enough to require an explanation.</p>

            <p>I’ve been following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_(band)">Nate Ruess</a>‘ music since <a
                    href="https://theformat.com/">The Format</a>‘s first studio album, <span class="album_tite"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Interventions-Lullabies-Format/dp/B0000DD51N/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1326421969&sr=1-1">Interventions
                        & Lullabies</a></span>
                (2003). The Format released a number of EPs and compilations, but two years after their second studio
                album release, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Problems-Format/dp/B000FVBLGQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1326421969&sr=1-2">Dog
                        Problems</a></span> (2006), the band announced a hiatus (later a disbandment). A year later, in
                2009, the band fun. had been formed and was releasing their first studio album, <span
                    class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Aim-Ignite-fun/dp/B002FOQY2M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326419308&sr=8-1">Aim

                being the lead in both The Format and fun. The track/video for <q>We Are Young</q> is currently
                streaming at
                the band’s <a href="http://www.ournameisfun.com/home/">website</a>. Though I enjoy The Format’s The
                Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomytracks more than
                fun.’s tracks, I still enjoy them and look forward to following Nate Ruess’ progression.</p>

            <div id="album-art-left">
                <div class="album-art-left"><img src="Album Art/Nada Surf - Stars are Indifferent.jpg"></div>
                <p>
                <h4><a href=" https://www.nadasurf.com/">Nada Surf</a> : <span class="album_title"><a
                            href="http://www.amazon.com/Stars-Are-Indifferent-Astronomy/dp/B006DICWUE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326419173&sr=8-1">The

                </p>

                <p>I don’t remember how or when I began listening to Nada Surf. I do recall seeing the band perform
                    live at
                    <a href="https://www.emosaustin.com/">Emo’s</a> in <a href="https://www.austintexas.org/">Austin,
                        TX</a>
                    during a tour after the release their <span class="album_title"><a

                    Unfortunately, I have not added the band’s previous albums to my collection, but I do hold a few
                    tracks
                    from all of them. Typically, Nada Surf albums are pretty easy to listen to and poppy. For the
                    most part,
                    I’m expecting more of the same. Consistency isn’t always a bad thing. Nada Surf’s <q><a

                    number of
                    other artists. If I do end up getting this album this year, maybe I’ll spend more time on this.

                    seems, in some ways as a slightly more depressed follow up to

                    Listening to it, I wonder if maybe it will become my anthem for this year. At least a slow
                    anthem. Any
                    ideas for a faster paced, up tempo anthem?

            <p>Beginning in 2002, I began listening to and following The Shins. I had found a few tracks on burned
                compilation discs that my brother had made and left behind after he had moved away from my parents
                house. Later the band’s songs were featured in the movies <a
                    href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295289/">A
                    Guy Thing</a> (2003) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/">Garden State</a> (2004)
                as
                well as numerous television spots, including a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald’s</a>
                commercial – fitting as the song used, <q><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwCmcB0XMw">New
                        Slang</a>,</q> includes the lyric <q>New slang when you notice the stripes, the dirt in your
                    fries.</q>
                Another
                memory I have of The Shins is riding shotgun in my <a href="http://www.inadequate.net/">brother</a>‘s
                1999 <a href="https://www.buick.com">Buick</a> Century southbound on Interstate
                35 toward downtown Austin. The windows were rolled down and he looked to me and told me the all too
                repeated phrase, <q>This song will change your life.</q> Unfortunately, The Shins’ third
                studio
                album, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Wincing-Night-Away-Shins/dp/B000K2VHN2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326420575&sr=8-1">Wincing
                        the Night Away</a></span> (2007), was not my favorite and seemed to have become slightly
                removed
                from the original Shins format. Hopefully, Shins front man <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mercer_(musician)">James Mercer</a> got this out of
                his
                system after
                his collaboration with <a href="https://Danger_Mouse">Danger Mouse</a> which produced the band and
                the
                self-titled album, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Broken-Bells/dp/B0031AV72Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326420762&sr=8-1">Broken
                        Bells</a></span>. I
                still will continue to anticipate Shins albums until I am completely disillusioned. I can only pray
                that
                The Shins continue to write decent lyrics and not give up the time spent on composing the
                arrangements
                as they have in the past with <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Oh-Inverted-World-Shins/dp/B00005JSHW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326421500&sr=8-1">Oh,
                        Inverted World</a></span> and <span class="album_title"><a
