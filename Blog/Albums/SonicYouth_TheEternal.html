            <p>Artist: <a href="http://www.sonicyouth.com/">Sonic Youth</a></p>
            <p>Album: <span class="album_title"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Sonic-Youth/dp/B0026BD2II">The
                        Eternal</a></span></p>
            <p>Released: June 9, 2009</p>
            <p>Label: <a href="http://www.matadorrecords.com/">Matador Records</a></p>
            <p>Rating: 8 / 10</p>

            <p><span class="album_title">The Eternal</span> is a great mix of what Sonic Youth has been known for. Their
                use of feedback, clashing
                guitar riffs and instrumental breaks are all there. <span class="album_title">The Eternal</span>
                contains more profound lyrics and is
                much more accessible than their last album, <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Rather-Ripped-Sonic-Youth/dp/B000FII31U">Rather Ripped</a></span>.
                While some
                listeners came staggering in with
                2006’s <span class="album_title">Rather Ripped</span>, this is precisely where Sonic Youth reclaims a
                once massive fan-base and air wave
                dominance.</p>

            <p>Sonic Youth has been putting out critically acclaimed albums since the early eighties. With every
                release reviewers, both professional and amateur, enthusiastically wrote about the band’s style and
                eloquence. Many reviewers seem to claim that a band with such a large collection of distinguished titles
                behind them could do no wrong. Unfortunately for listeners, bands will often do wrong and no band has
                acquired an immunity to such horrendous acts.</p>

            <p>Nearly all of the well-established music reviewers gave Sonic Youth’s last album, <span
                    class="album_title">Rather Ripped</span>,
                spectacular ratings: 80 out of 100, four to six stars – depending on the ranking system; very few had
                any critique of the band, if at all. The last album was aptly titled. The album was and is amazing and
                did and still does deserve the remarkable ratings, though the praise may have been premature.</p>

            <p>The opening track, <q>Sacred Trickster,</q> places the album’s Achilles’ heel right up front. It only has
                two
                possible saviors: The fact that it serves perfectly, through the opening instrumentation, as an
                introductory track and possibly the line <q>I wish I could be / Music on a tree.</q> The track welcomes
                listeners back and pulls them in before they know it, as the song ends in just over two minutes.</p>

            <p>Following the opening track is <q>Anti-Orgasm,</q> which highlights the band as a modern contender. Sonic
                Youth have always been able to write <q>people watching</q> lyrics. They comment on the world, not
                necessarily holding to a specific opinion. Just as the lyrics suggest, <q>Anti-war (is anti-orgasm).</q>
                While I would venture to guess the band doesn’t take a pro-war stance, they certainly understand the
                chaos involved in both, war and sex.</p>

            <p>Of course, the band does have some moments of recalling their past. <q>Calming the Snake</q> seems as if
                it
                may be retrofitted from 1987’s <span class="album_title">Sister</span>. <q>Poison Arrow</q> narrowly
                escapes, through the use of composition
                and vocal styling, from being pegged as poor lyric writing. <q>Thunderclap (For Bobby Pyn),</q> written
                for
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darby_Crash">Jan Paul
                    Beahm</a> (Darby Crash, Bobby Pyn) of the late band <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germs_(band)">The Germs</a>, is a short, well orchestrated, even
                at times of chaos, ode to a fellow punk musician. It’s one of the best tracks from the album. The
                closing track <q>Massage the History</q> is artistic in its own way, but also a misstep of the band.
            </p>

            <p>A primary concern; however, is the reappearance of the term “overview” in many reviews for not only
                Sonic Youth’s newest album, but for albums of the recent past. This suggests that the last few albums
                were merely statements of <q>look at what we’ve done in the past.</q> Not unlike <a
                    href="http://yolatengo.com">Yo La Tengo</a>’s 2006
                release,
                <span class="album_title"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Afraid-Will-Beat-Your/dp/B000GUK0HM">I Am
                        Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass</a></span>. That album actually was a sort of
                overview or survey
                course in Yo La Tengo. <span class="album_title">Rather Ripped</span>, <span class="album_title">The
                    Eternal</span> and others are not this type of album. While reviewers
                and listeners do like to see growth and maturity, they seem to be expecting more than what is actually
                necessary. With the time taken to listen to the album fully, it is obvious that Sonic Youth has grown
                and has matured in their two decades of recording. Never has consistently releasing great albums been
                detrimental to a band.
