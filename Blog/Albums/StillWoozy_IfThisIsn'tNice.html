        <div class="article_text">
            <p>Having had the change to see Still Woozy at a music festival and sample some of his tracks in 2019, I was
                moderately
                intrigued and looking forward to his debut album.</p>

            <p>Setting the stage with <q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r95kvUdBl-k">Woof</a>,</q> Sven Eric
                Gamsky (<a href="https://www.woozystill.com/">Still
                    Woozy</a>), treats the listener with a tempo and
                beat
                reminiscent
                of
                <a href="https://rarariot.com/">Ra Ra Riot</a> and <a href="https://www.hot-chip.co.uk/">Hot Chip</a>
                while, offering a peak into his mind
                as he sings,
            </p>

            <blockquote>There you go, your ducks in a row / So many things you'll never know / If you want it I can show
                you
                but....You
                wouldn't last a day in my head....You'd probably go insane / You's probably never be the same again.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Gamsky, while inviting the listener to spend a day in his mind, then denies entry, <q>I bet you wanna
                    know / Why I
                    keep
                    my
                    windows closed / It's not baggage it's cargo...</q> and claims that his experiences, failures,
                depressions were
                somehow
                more difficult, worse, or deeper than others', <q>You like to think that you had it rough / But I'm
                    gonna call your
                    bluff
                    / And you pray it's been enough....</q></p>

            <p>While the track is narrow-minded and egocentric, it remains to be the best and most enjoyable of the
                album.</p>

            <p>It is not until track 5 that we're rewarded with <q><a href="https://youtu.be/yhcWH8KZXEg">Get
                        By</a></q>. The up beat, foot-tappable rhythm
                inaccurately coaxes
                the
                listener into giving up another 23 minutes of valuable listening time.</p>

            <p>Lyrically, the album reminds me of something I would have written as a depressed teenager with a limited
                vocabulary
                and
                a disdain for the thesaurus. There is about as much originality and lyrical variation as <a
                    href="https://www.thebeatles.com/">The Beatles</a>'
                <q><a href=https://youtu.be/0JWl_wUOQc4">Love Me
                        Do</a></q>.
                In
                fact, this incredible lack of creativity and uniqueness is readily apparent in <q><a
                        href="https://youtu.be/V1xInwh6-Mk">Get Down</a>.</q> Gamsky's
                blatant
                affinity
                for
                <a href="https://www.daftpunk.com/">Daft Punk</a>'s <q><a href="https://youtu.be/CCHdMIEGaaM">Get
                        Lucky</a></q> is glaringly obvious in both,
                title and lyricism.
            </p>

            <p>At moments I am transported to a coffeeshop with Hot Chip's The Warning whispering from the loudspeakers.
                But the
                moments pass quickly, as they often do in <span class="album_title">If This Isn't Nice, I Don't Know
                    What Is</span>.
                The hole from which Gamsky is
                seen
                attempting to crawl out of <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Isnt-Nice-Dont-Explicit/dp/B097CRRXW5"></a>on the album's
                cover</a> is assuredly one of self-absorption, dug on his own.
                There, I said
                it.
                You - Gamsky - dug your own grave.</p>

            <p>I'll take a softly played Hot Chip or <a href="https://opensource.glassanimals.com/">Glass Animals</a>
                album over Still Woozy's <span class="album_title">If
                    This Isn't
                    Nice, I Don't Know What
                    Is</span>
                any day.</p>
