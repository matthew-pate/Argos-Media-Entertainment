            <p>Artist: <a href="http://www.conoroberst.com/">Conor Oberst</a> and The Mystic Valley Band</p>
            <p>Album: Outer South</p>
            <p>Released: May 5, 2009</p>
            <p>Label: <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/">Merge Records</a></p>
            <p>Rating: 4.8 / 10</p><br>

            <p>Conor Oberst has decided to remove himself from the teen angst that has fueled his past albums under
                the
                moniker <a href="http://www.thisisbrighteyes.com/">Bright Eyes</a>. This is rather unfortunate. While it
                is commendable for an artist to desire to
                branch out from his carved-out niche, Oberst is the case in point that we shall forever refer to
                when
                describing musicians taking wrong turns.</p>

            <p>One who has such a following should hold fast. Granted, musicians should grow, not always away from
                their
                roots, but possibly into their roots. Oberst’s 2008 self-titled album was genuinely heart-felt with
                quality writing. <span class="album_title">Outer South</span> is neither. In fact, it sounds almost
                nothing like the other albums in
                Oberst’s discography. <span class="album_title">Outer South</span> should more aptly be an album filed
                under The Mystic Valley Band
                with
                songs featuring Conor Oberst.</p>

            <p>Oberst decided to team up with The Mystic Valley Band to create a less-than-mediocre album that
                requires
                patience to find its high points, hidden in each track.</p>

            <p>The opener, <q>Slowly (Oh So Slowly)</q> is an upbeat folk-pop song that completely deceives the
                listener.
                At
                times Oberst is appears to be channeling <a href="http://bobdylan.com/">Bob Dylan</a>, but falls
                incredibly short. It’s dreadful enough
                to
                attempt to mimic a great artist such as Dylan; it’s even worse to fail horribly at doing so. <q>Air
                    Mattress</q> should have been seriously reconsidered, just as the majority of the album should have
                been.
                It’s fairly easy to notice where Oberst’s influences the album and where the members of The Mystic
                Valley Band influence the album.</p>

            <p><span class="album_title">Outer South</span> does have good points. It’s not entirely a sloppy piece of
                work; however, even most of
                the
                finest parts of <span class="album_title">Outer South</span> are easy to ignore. The album should be
                stripped and sold for parts, in
                that, the songs worthy of being recorded sold as singles or EPs and the coat tailing songs be laid
                to
                rest.</p>
