            <p>In a debut album riddled with purposeful responses to those who claimed she’d never make it in the
                industry, <a href="https://www.alicemerton.com/">Alice Merton</a>‘s strong-willed and persevering lyrics
                are impaired by what may be assumed as her
                insecurities. As the bass hits, those impactful moments are narrowly missed or avoided. It’s almost as
                if Merton’s search for a <q>home</q> can be felt even in the denial that it is underway. Merton can be
                heard
                fighting to live on her own terms and timing while borrowing from others.</p>

            <p>Prior to <span class="album_title"><a href="http://hyperurl.co/AliceMerton-Mint">MINT</a></span>, titled
                for Merton’s <a href="http://atwoodmagazine.com/mint-alice-merton-interview-2019/">stress-relieving
                    aid</a>, I had only experienced the artist through radio
                plays of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUdyuKaGQd4">No Roots</a>,” “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IryLa6_9bxc">Lash Out</a>,” and an endearing set played at <a
                    href="https://www.aclfestival.com/">Austin City Limits Music Festival</a> (ACL).
                The radio plays concerned me — “No Roots” had been exhausted and “Lash Out,” though it had come as a
                breath of fresh air, was following suit.</p>

            <p>At ACL, my wife and I found ourselves at Merton’s set out of respect for the radio plays and due to the
                lack of other performers scheduled during Merton’s time slot. It was a pleasant surprise. If this were a
                review of Merton’s ACL performance, it would certainly be much more positive. Her interaction with the
                audience and her story-telling between songs was among the best I had seen in years at the festival.</p>

            <p><span class="album_title">MINT</span> is filled with peaks and valleys. The unfortunate truth: The peaks
                don’t deliver and the valleys
                leave the listener wanting – expecting meaning that was never flushed out or entrusted to the listener.
            </p>

            <p>The opening track, “<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I51C1GtzRs4">Learn To Live</a>,” propels the
                album’s expectation established by both, “No Roots” and
                “Lash Out.” It also lays out Merton’s primary objective: To live without consequences. Yet, somewhat
                unexpectedly, the track is followed by the tale of a chance meeting at a bus stop with an approach
                similar to that of Tegan & Sara.</p>

            <p>“No Roots” quickly became overplayed and “Lash Out” was a breath of fresh air when it entered the daily
                line-up. Although the track had been exhausted, it wasn’t until I listened closer that I truly heard
                Merton’s claim, or realization, that “[her] home was never on the ground.” It’s interesting how one can
                be exhausted by a track, but find a connection through the lyricism – regardless of the level of
                complexity.</p>

            <p>It’s not until after these introductory tracks that we come upon my favorites of the album, “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lleYJOwpRC8">Funny
                    Business</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjOjo5SFoUg">Homesick</a>.” Paired with
                a beat that you can tap your heel to, a clap-able rhythm, and a
                catchy hook – “I don’t break hearts / I don’t do funny business / I just ride in cars and watch them get
                hung up in it” – make “Funny Business” an easy favorite and eases the listener into the piano-heavy,
                “Homesick”, brimming with influences such as <a href="http://www.reginaspektor.com/">Regina Spektor</a>
                and <a href="https://www.sarabmusic.com/main/">Sara Bareilles</a>. Repetitiously, she
                sings, “I don’t feel alone-lone-lone-lone-lone-lone-lone-lone-lone.” As if she is either proud to have
                found someone or simply trying to make herself believe it’s true.</p>

            <p>In many ways, <span class="album_title">MINT</span> is an album for nomads – anyone who has experienced a
                life of goodbyes. Whether it be
                physically moving away, emotionally leaving others, or missed opportunities.</p>

            <p>In a recent <a href="http://atwoodmagazine.com/mint-alice-merton-interview-2019/">interview</a>, Merton
                stated that she felt, <q>like [her] identity has definitely been carved from
                    the fact that [she] keep[s] on saying goodbye.</q></p>

            <p>In the same interview Merton expresses that she is <q>so bad at making up [her] mind</q> because she has
                <q>a
                    thousand thoughts,</q> but that it’s part of her identity. She connects with those who call
                themselves
                nomads or refuse to claim a home as she has “never been able to put [her] feet in the ground.” She
                explains that “they’re on the ground, but they’re never in it. And it really annoys [her] sometimes.”
            </p>

            <p>“Lash Out” carries a heavy bass line and is festival ready – I know, I was there. It resembles The <a
                    href="https://thetingtings.com/">Ting
                    Tings</a>‘ “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tolm-07if3c">Shut Up and Let Me Go</a>” and “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1c2OfAzDTI">That’s Not My Name</a>.”</p>

            <p>With all the obvious influences, it’s easy to spot a Canadian influence. <a
                    href="https://alanis.com/">Alanis Morissett</a> can be heard in
                many tracks, even the softer “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eElqIYrPGWU">Speak your
                    Mind</a>.” Even here, we see where the lyricism, while rather
                simple, can overpower the composition when given its due consideration.</p>

            <p>Another favorite, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4CTH3Dqun4">I Don’t Hold A Grudge</a>” is a
                solid track. Had dance steps been included, it would
                provide stiff competition to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_Level_Midnight">The
                    Scarn</a>.” And that’s a compliment. Fans of Wild Child will immediately
                enjoy “Honeymoon Heartbreak” with it’s folk-turned-rock aesthetics.</p>

            <p>The album is sprinkled with undertones of <a href="https://www.fiona-apple.com/">Fiona Apple</a> and akin
                to <a href="https://florenceandthemachine.net/">Florence & The Machine</a>. At the end of
                the album, I’m still left wanting more, more depth, more detail, more bass, more treble. Just, more.</p>

            <p>It’s the final track that really speaks – of childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and the future.</p>

            <q>...I wanna live in the now / I’m not gonna live in the past / Don’t wanna care about what-ifs / ‘Cause
                what if those things don’t last? / And I wanna live with no regrets / I wanna live in the now / I’m not
                gonna live in the past....</q>
