            <p><a href="https://www.mattandkim.com">Matt & Kim</a>’s <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Matt-Kim/dp/B001KY47RW">Grand</a></span> is a decent
                piece of work, but most assuredly
                will be
                placed in many of
                the
                listener-elite’s guilty pleasures list.</p>

            <p>The first track, <q>Daylight</q>, is an upbeat, poppy song that features nasally vocals. The lyrics
                aren’t
                half bad – easy to decipher, but not extremely blatant. Though the instrumentation masks and directs
                attention away from the lyrics, the track, <q>Daylight</q>, features lyrics like: <q>These shoes are
                    poor
                    man’s
                    ice skates.... I hope that someday I’ll see without these frames.... I have five clocks in my
                    life /
                    And
                    only
                    one has the time right / I’ll just unplug it for today....”</p>

            <p>There’s an easy connection made between the piano/keyboard-prominent Matt & Kim and the
                piano/keyboard-prominent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matesofstate">Mates Of State</a>. Matt & Kim;
                however, allow themselves to more easily be
                placed
                in a “guilty pleasure” list rather than in a list, like Mates Of State, of more respectable and
                better
                quality music.</p>

            <p>Matt & Kim make good use of stomp-clapping percussion in <q>Good Ol’ Fashion Nightmare</q>. The song
                becomes
                even more enjoyable with the use of percussion and more thoughtful lyrics, like: </q>show me the side
                streets in your life / train yards like bone yards sharpened knives.</q></p>

            <p>By the time Grand makes it to <q>I Wanna</q>, it is apparent that Matt & Kim are at their best when they
                are
                playing faster and are seemingly rushing. Unfortunately, </q>I Wanna</q> lacks any major lyrical genius.
            </p>

            <p>One of the best verses of the album is featured in </q>Don’t Slow Down</q>. While it’s not extremely
                metaphorical or mystifying to any degree, it is incredibly relatable. The verse is the first in the
                song
                and the only part really worth listening. The rest is good for the
                instrumentation. Matt & Kim recount to many a familiar party night, <q>Locked knees, no keys /
                    Brooklyn,
                    Grand Street / four flights, late nights / black socks, white dice / ten pounds, loud sounds /
                    turned
                    up, tied & bound</q>.</p>

            <p>Of course, Grand is somewhat of misnomer. Possibly they should have considered naming the album <span
                    class="album_title">Good</span>?
