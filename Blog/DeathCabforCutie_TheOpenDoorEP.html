            <p>Though <a href="www.deathcabforcutie.com">Death Cab For Cutie</a> has forever changed their sound,
                listening to them continues to be a love
                –
                even when the band yields sub-par arrangements and lyrics. Of course, this is uncommon for the band.
            </p>


            <p>Death Cab For Cutie has been wrongly clumped into the category of modern emo music in recent years.
                This
                newest strain of emo music that has hit the mainstream airwaves is not tradition, nor is it decent.
                The
                new strain mares all past respectable compositions of emo music. This is something Death Cab For
                Cutie
                is not. Death Cab For Cutie is, in fact, an indie-rock band.</p>

            <p><span class="album_title"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Door-Death-Cab-Cutie/dp/B001YIOWVU">The
                        Open Door EP</a></span> is a small collection of tracks not included on the band’s latest
                full-length album
                <span class="album_title"><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Stairs-Death-Cab-Cutie/dp/B00192BEGC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ZK5V87GFFVN&dchild=1&keywords=narrow+stairs+death+cab&qid=1629577661&s=dmusic&sprefix=narrow+s%2Cdigital-music%2C191&sr=1-1">Narrow
                        Stairs</span></a>, though the band refuses to label them b-sides. The tracks are all too
                <q>happy</q>
                to be
                added to Narrow Stairs, save for the demo version of <q>Talking Birds.</q>
            </p>


            <p>The first track <q>Little Bribes</q> sets the upbeat, head-bobbing, foot-tapping mood of the EP.
                Death
                Cab
                For Cutie seldom uses poor lyrics – and <q>Little Bribes</q> is no different. The band merges images
                of
                slot
                machines and robots in the line: <q>Pretend every slot machine is a robot amputee waving hello / the
                    people stare into their eyes / and they feed them little bribes and then they go</q>. Further in
                the
                song
                we see the lyrics continue the introspection that is prevalent in most of Death Cab For Cutie’s
                work:
            <blockquote>You said this city has a beating heart / That pushes people down the boulevard / And they’re all
                hoping
                for a wish fulfilled / In a desert for a dollar bill / Those foolish dreams, you know they
                plague me
                still.... And oh so empty were the faces of the dealers and the waitresses around.</blockquote>
            </p>

            <p><q>A Diamond And A Tether</q> contains the story of a man who has issues with commitment. It’s a
                great
                track,
                but has no lyric that stands alone or above the rest. The track holds a decent chorus, but, like the
                rest of <span class="album_title">The Open Door EP</span>, is forgettable – that is, until you hear
                it
                again. Luckily, you fall in love
                all over.</p>

            <p><q>My Mirror Speaks</q> seems to draw images of a young adult, passionate in his life, trying to find
                meaning
                and duty, but becomes disillusioned by the world. <q>I Was Once A Loyal Lover</q> is most like older
                Death
                Cab tracks, as it seems to be somewhat unfinished and unpolished – the things, aside from great
                lyrics
                and style, that generally coaxed people into listening to the band back in 1998. <q>I Was Once A
                    Loyal
                    Lover</q> is most likened to a relationship in which someone has been disenchanted by past
                relationships
                and is, like in Death Cab For Cutie’s <span class="album_title"><a

                    ’86,</q> <q>waiting for something to go
                    wrong</q> or waiting for <q>crippling defeat.</q></p><br>
