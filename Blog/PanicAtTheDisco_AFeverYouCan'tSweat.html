            <p>I completely agree with <a
                    href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6586-a-fever-you-cant-sweat-out/">this</a> review of
                <a href="https://panicatthedisco.com">Panic! At the Disco</a>. As I told Ben, earlier today, the band
                members must have had nothing better to do than make dance music that really sucked. It’s all
                mainstream-ready. And, I don’t hate the band nearly as much as I hate <a
                    href="https://falloutboy.com/">Fall Out Boy</a> (and I really hate
                Fall Out Boy, I can’t listen to them), so that’s something. And, they do have a few good lyrics, but, as
                the review says, <q>The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there,
                    but there’s no sincerity, creativity, or originality.</q>
            </p>

            <p>So, I like it, but I hate it. It’s sad, as the reviewer pointed out, that this is what emo/indie music is
                coming to. But, I called it. A couple years ago. I knew the pop/rock and emo/indie scene would collide.
            </p>

            <p>Ben helped me to describe this band. I think the album is all about the beats and the rhythm. Not so much
                for creativity. Ben also pointed out that the vocals sounded an awful lot like that of Fall Out Boy.
                But, it is not the same person. However, one of the members of Fall Out Boy did sign this band to their
                label and help produce the album, <span class="album_title">A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out</span>. We also
                looked at the album art,
                displaying a picture of the group members and one of them looked like a guy from <a
                    href="https://www.mychemicalromance.com">My Chemical Romance</a>,
                Ben pointed out.</p>

            <p>Panic! At the Disco’s (P!ATD) lyrics are well written and don’t take much to grasp the meaning of each
                song.</p>

            <p>It’s really a good album to listen to and feel happy about. I love the way the band slams the <q>wanna-be
                    scene-sters</q> with <q>I Constantly Thank God for Esteban</q>. It’s really good music to drive fast
                to and jam
                to with friends. And, it’s also fun to make fun of.</p>

            <p>I hope the band matures. I’d like to see what they could do when they aren’t trying to bridge the gap
                between pop-rock and indie-rock.</p>
