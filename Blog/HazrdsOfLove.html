                was
                made
                available on <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>
                10 years ago today, March 17, 2009. The
                record was
                released a week later on March 24, 2009.</p>
            <p> It wasn’t unexpected. It wasn’t shockingly different from what we had heard in the past. Fans of The
                Decemberists didn’t
                mind the work it required to unfurl the lyrics, they had enjoyed the constant dictionary consults and
                imagery in the
                past. In fact, I’ll require their discography as required listening for my daughter – when she’s old
                enough – to
                increase her own vocabulary.</p>
            <p>It was, in some respects, a line in the sand.</p>
            <p>It was the type of album that one would aspire to create – if they aspired to create a rock-opera
                reminiscent of Led
                Zepplin, Pink Floyd, or The Who. Complete with a children’s choir which conjurede thoughts of The
                Rolling Stones, The
                Hazards Of Love, was most nearly a signal that The Crane Wife, not Picaresque, would be their last indie
                record. While
                Picaresque was the last to be released on an indie label, Kill Rock Stars, Crane Wife certainly held
                much closer to the
                band’s roots.</p>
            <p>Unlike many of the bands during this era that had made the indie-to-major-label jump, The Decemberists
                had been able to
                maintain their sound and following. They proved with both, Crane Wife and Hazards, that a band did not
                have to sacrifice
                their sound, their fanbase, or their roots to find further success on a major label.</p>
            <p>“…if you hate sweeping tales that invoke mythology and fantasy, you’re not going to find much to like….On
                The Crane
                Wife, the band’s previous LP, songs varied between conventional acoustic rock tracks…and indie epics….
                Although that was
                the Portland-based band’s first big label release, it proved that they could keep their literate, albeit
                esoteric, style
                and make it accessible to a wide audience.” – Alex Young, CoS</p>
            <p>As the first decade of the 21st century was coming to a close, where iPods ran on shuffle and streaming
                was beginning
                its massive explosion, The Decemberists released an album which nearly required the listener to follow
                the story from
                “Prelude” to “The Hazards Of Love 4 (The Drowned).” It was 2009’s The Wall, and your college roommate
                most assuredly
                forced you to listen to the entire 17 track, hour-long rock-opera from start to finish without a break.
                It wouldn’t be
                until years later that you’d actually return to the album to truly take it in.</p>
            <p>While elements of past albums reappear, they do less for Hazards than one might expect. The
                shape-shifting creatures,
                the tales of rape, children, and murder are all there, but the album lacks the one-liners and hooks that
                made Castaways
                and Cutouts and Her Majesty the Decemberists such great, iconic albums. I recall walking the halls of my
                middle and high
                schools with “July, July!,” “The Soldiering Life,” and “Red Right Ankle,” among others spinning in my
                head.</p>
            <p>“In an interview with Paste, singing guitarist/songwriter Colin Meloy mentioned that The Hazards of Love
                was ‘initially
                conceived as a musical…but I decided about halfway through my time in France that it wasn’t going to
                work as a stage
                piece. But it would still work as a rock record….'” – Marc Hogan, Pitchfork</p>
            <p>Agreeably, where Hazards failed as a musical, may be exactly where it fails as a record.</p>
            <p>Long-time listeners were provided few “treasures” — as my daughter would call them. Tracks like “The
                Wanting Comes In
                Waves/Repaid,” “The Hazards Of Love 4 (The Drowned),” “Margaret In Captivity,” and few others are our
                tokens for being
                benevolent listeners and fans.</p>
            <p>Long-time listeners respected the discipline that this and past albums have taken to create, especially
                given how each
                track bleeds into the next. Those who loved the story depicted in Crane Wife will enjoy this continued
                narrative style.
                Those of us who were looking for more sea chanteys would have to look to the past and pray for the
                future.</p>
            <p>Where the album truly won was in its story — the epic. While some claimed that the story, lyricism, and
                composition work
                better in Hazards than in The Who’s Tommy, specifically, “Pinball Wizard,” I must disagree.</p>
            <p>I further disagree with Drowned In Sound‘s Alexander Tudor‘s assumption that Hazards “could bring more
                fans than ever
                before, because the constraints of the rock-opera mean that Meloy’s writing some of his simplest, most
                immediately
                affecting songs.” While the lyricism is certainly more accessible, your average or mainstream listener
                isn’t typically
                interested in deep, thought-provoking tales of rape, murder, or even love. The discipline it took to
                create the album, I
                would argue, is proportional to the discipline it takes to listen to the album.</p>
            <p>In an age of singles — shuffling tracks and streaming services — rock-operas and full length albums need
                to adapt. While
                it’s an amazing effort, more accessible lyricism doesn’t generate hour-long listeners. Unless, of
                course, you’re gearing
                up for a particular show and want your lip-syncing to be on point.</p>
            <p>There’s no denying that the album requires your full attention and a good hour and a half — if not more —
                to to reflect.</p>
            <p>And, since we’re living in the future, I can break the news to everyone: The future is bright. It has
                been 10 years and,
                as Colin Meloy sings at the close of the rock-opera, “these hazards of love, never more will trouble
                us.”</p>
