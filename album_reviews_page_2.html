                <p>The first track, <q>Daylight</q>, is an upbeat, poppy song that features nasally vocals. The

                    aren’t
                    half bad – easy to decipher, but not extremely blatant. Though the instrumentation masks and
                    directs
                    attention away from the lyrics, the track, <q>Daylight</q>, features lyrics like: <q>These shoes

                </p>


                <p>Death Cab For Cutie has been wrongly clumped into the category of modern emo music in recent years.
                    This
                    newest strain of emo music that has hit the mainstream airwaves is not tradition, nor is it decent.
                    The

                    Cutie
                    is not. Death Cab For Cutie is, in fact, an indie-rock band. <a

                    While it is commendable for an artist to desire to

                    times straight

                    stress and
                    disappointment,
                    there’s always something to be optimistic about. This reminiscence isn’t due to the lyrics,
                    rather
                    it is
                    due to the
                    sloppy arrangement of instruments which the lyrics combine with. Nada Surf reminds me of a
