                    decent piece of work, but most assuredly
                    will be placed in many of
                    the
                    listener-elites' guilty pleasures list.</p>

                <p>The first track, <q>Daylight</q>, is an upbeat, poppy song that features nasally vocals. The
                    lyrics
                    aren’t
                    half bad – easy to decipher, but not extremely blatant. Though the instrumentation masks and
                    directs
                    attention away from the lyrics, the track, <q>Daylight</q>, features lyrics like: <q>These shoes
                        are

                    listening to them continues to be a love
                    –
                    even when the band yields sub-par arrangements and lyrics. Of course, this is uncommon for the band.
                </p>


                <p>Death Cab For Cutie has been wrongly clumped into the category of modern emo music in recent years.
                    This
                    newest strain of emo music that has hit the mainstream airwaves is not tradition, nor is it decent.
                    The
                    new strain mares all past respectable compositions of emo music. This is something Death Cab For
                    Cutie
                    is not. Death Cab For Cutie is, in fact, an indie-rock band.</p>

                <p>With so many new albums released every year, how are we, the listener, supposed to relate to
                    each
                    and every one? It’s just not possible. At least not at the very moment of its release. When
                    I
                    heard Michael Franti & Spearhead’s Yell Fire! in 2006, I couldn’t relate. Or, I wasn’t in
                    the
                    mood to hear it and relate to it. Music takes time. You have to listen numerous times
                    throughout
                    your life to connect to it. It wasn’t until about seven (7) years after Yell Fire!’s release
                    that I began to enjoy it. <a href="blog/DeathCabForCutie_Kintsugi.html">Continue

                    stress and
                    disappointment,
                    there’s always something to be optimistic about. This reminiscence isn’t due to the lyrics,
                    rather
                    it is
                    due to the
                    sloppy arrangement of instruments which the lyrics combine with. Nada Surf reminds me of a
